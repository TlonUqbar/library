# library
The Odin Project: Project - Library. Create a small Library app. I guess I missed the "small" part. I got too excited again and it got away from me. I added 2 APIs - Open Libray and NYTimes Bestsellers Lists - when I didn't need to, as a result I had a lot of scope creep. It took a while, I struggled a lot and learned a lot. Check it out.
